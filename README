Alternative firmware for the CrazePony MiniQuad quadcopter

Hardware vendors website: http://www.crazepony.com/products/mini.html

This is a "just for fun" project, as the original firmware isn't very tinker-friendly
due to it relying on Keil uVision (aka, Windows), all the comments in the code is
in chinese, and not being very easy to follow.

Current status:
TX is fully operational. It sends a 9-byte packet continously with 250Kbps ESB @ CH2
to the drone, which contains all axises and button statuses.
Quad/Drone has most of the hardware working, _except_ the MPU-6050, which is required
for getting anything remotely close to stable flight.

Be aware, if you flash this firmware, the Quad will start its motors as soon as it gets
a signal from the TX. They're not going fast enough for fligh, but they're going fast
enough to hurt.
